# donnalee-workday-scheduler

## Description
This challenge required me to create a Workday Scheduler application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9AM-5PM). The starter code was provided but updates was made in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (powered by jQuery) to fulfill the acceptance criteria. 

## Installation
My responsibility was to satisfy the acceptance criteria, create a new repository on GitHub, commit and push any changes to the repository, and deploy to GitHub Pages to view the website live. The HTML code is available on index.html, the CSS code is available on style.css, and JavaScript code is available on script.js in the donnalee-workday-scheduler folder.

## Usage
The Workday Scheduler already had a foundation with the provided starter code, but changes were made to fulfill the acceptance criteria. 

The current date is visible in the header of the body. The example shows that the current date is July 18, 2023.

The time blocks change colors depending on whether they are past (#d3d3d3), present (#ff6961), or future (#77dd77).

ADD IMAGE

When adding an event in the time block and clicking the button with the disk icon (save button), the event saves to the Workday Scheduler. When you refresh the page, the event is set and saved on the Workday Scheduler (local storage). The event will be removed when the user manually removes the event and clicks the button with the disk icon (save button).
